The trunks and leaves are carved out of the same panels as the background. The geckos, which are approximately 3.5 feet long each - are carved from separate pieces of wood, which are attached to the surface of the reliefs. Installed over the entrance to the Paul L. Breese animalani. Located at the Honolulu Zoo Herpatarium entrance.",

They are massive in composition, the details of their appearance are subtly articulated. They sit in a pool that is dry but has a drain. The artist was the zoo's director. The piece was constructed with the intention of its being a \"play sculpture\" for children. From a 1974 memo: \"...the fountain will have several inches of water in it. The children of Honolulu could have a joyous time playing in the water and climbing on the hippos, whose surfaces would be made smooth, resin-coated Belonza quartz.\" Located at the Honolulu Zoo.",

The accompanying plaque reads, \"'This is my Hawaii... here I was brought up and educated; and it was here that I came to know what modern, civilized governments are like and what they mean.' Dr. Sun Yat-sen. In 1879, at the age of thirteen, Sun Yat-sen came to Hawaii from Zhongshan, China. It was here in Honolulu, that he spent many of his teenage years growing up and being educated. China's first revolutionary society the Xing Zhong Hui (Revive China Society) was organized in Hawaii in 1894. Sun Yat-sen went to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and establish a democratic China in 1911. The dedication of this statue recognizes t he sacrifice and support of the people of Hawaii in nurturing the roots of 'Modern China' and it's Founding Father.
